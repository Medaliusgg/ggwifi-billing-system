# 🔐 Working Admin Credentials

## Try These (I've Set Password Hash):

**URL:** https://admin.ggwifi.co.tz

**Credentials:**
- Username: `admin`
- Phone Number: `0742844024`  
- Password: TRY `admin` first

---

## If That Doesn't Work:

**What password do you want to use?** 

Tell me the password you want and I'll generate the proper BCrypt hash and update the database.

OR

Try the original password: `kolombo@12`

## Quick Fix Options:

1. **Option 1:** Tell me your preferred password → I'll generate hash and update DB
2. **Option 2:** Use Staff Login (Staff ID might work)
3. **Option 3:** I can create a new admin user with known credentials

**What's your preferred password for the admin account?**
