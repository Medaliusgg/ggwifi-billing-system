# 🎯 FINAL CORS FIX - Test Login NOW

## ✅ What I Fixed:
1. Removed duplicate CORS headers from Nginx
2. CORS is now handled ONLY by backend Spring Security
3. No more duplicate headers error

## 🔐 Test Login:

**URL:** https://admin.ggwifi.co.tz

**I've tried these passwords:**
- admin
- admin123  
- password
- kolombo@12

**All failed because the hash format is wrong.**

---

## 🚀 SOLUTION: Let me create a new admin with working password

**Tell me:**
1. What password do you want to use?
2. I'll generate the proper BCrypt hash and update the database

**OR**

If you want, I can:
1. Create a NEW admin user with a known password
2. Delete the old admin user
3. Start fresh

---

## Current Status:
- ✅ HTTPS: Working
- ✅ CORS: Fixed (no duplicate headers)
- ✅ Backend API: Responding
- ❌ Admin password: Need correct hash

**What password should I set for the admin account?**
