## New Amounts

- **Simple Payment Tests:** 100 TSH (reduced from 5000 TSH)
- **Integration Tests:** 1000 TSH (reduced from 50000 TSH)

## Reason for Change

Payment testing amount of 500 TSH was considered too high for testing purposes. Reduced to 100 TSH for simple tests and 1000 TSH for integration tests to minimize costs during testing.
