## 🎯 Ready for Deployment

### Your GitHub Repository:
**URL**: `https://github.com/Medaliusgg/ggwifi-billing-system`

### Key Files Added:
- `.github/workflows/deploy-backend.yml` - Automated deployment workflow
- `setup-vps-for-deployment.sh` - VPS preparation script
- `GITHUB_VPS_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` - Complete deployment guide
- `README.md` - Comprehensive documentation

## 🚀 Next Steps to Deploy

### 1. Prepare Your VPS (5 minutes)
```bash
# Update VPS IP in the script
nano setup-vps-for-deployment.sh
# Change: VPS_IP="your-vps-ip-address"

# Run the setup script
./setup-vps-for-deployment.sh
```

### 2. Configure GitHub Secrets (5 minutes)
Go to: `https://github.com/Medaliusgg/ggwifi-billing-system/settings/secrets/actions`

Add these secrets:
```
VPS_HOST=your-vps-ip-address
VPS_USER=root
VPS_PORT=22
VPS_SSH_KEY=your-private-ssh-key
DB_USERNAME=ggnetworks
DB_PASSWORD=secure_password
ZENOPAY_API_KEY=your-zenopay-api-key
SMS_API_KEY=your-sms-api-key
JWT_SECRET=your-super-secret-jwt-key
```

### 3. Deploy Backend (Automatic)
```bash
# Push to main branch triggers automatic deployment
git add .
git commit -m "Deploy backend"
git push origin main
```

### 4. Monitor Deployment
- Go to: `https://github.com/Medaliusgg/ggwifi-billing-system/actions`
- Watch the "Deploy Backend to VPS" workflow
- Check for success/failure status

## 🧪 Testing After Deployment

### Health Check:
```bash
curl http://your-vps-ip:8080/actuator/health
```

### Admin Login:
```bash
curl -X POST http://your-vps-ip:8080/api/auth/admin-login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username":"admin","phoneNumber":"0676591880","password":"admin123"}'
```

### Get Packages:
```bash
curl http://your-vps-ip:8080/api/packages/active
```
