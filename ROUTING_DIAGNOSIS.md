# Diagnosis: Component Logs Issue

## What I See:
✅ Login works
✅ Dashboard renders
✅ MainLayout renders multiple times
❌ No logs from other page components (Users, Customers, etc.)

## Possible Causes:

1. **Navigation not working** - Clicking sidebar items doesn't navigate
2. **Pages not rendering** - Routes load but components don't mount
3. **API calls failing** - Pages try to fetch but fail silently
4. **Outlet issue** - MainLayout's `<Outlet />` not rendering child routes

## What to Test:

1. **Open browser console**
2. **Click on "Users" in sidebar**
3. **Check console for:**
   - Navigation logs (should see MainLayout with location: '/users')
   - Network requests (should see API call to /admin/users)
   
4. **If you see errors**, share them

## Expected Behavior:
When you click a menu item, you should see:
- MainLayout log with new location
- Page component renders (if it has console.log)
- Network requests to backend API

## What's Actually Happening:
The MainLayout is rendering but we're not seeing page-specific logs, which means:
- Either the routes aren't working
- Or the page components don't have console.logs
- Or there's an error preventing pages from rendering

## Solution:
**Try clicking on "Users" or "Customers" in the sidebar and tell me what you see:**
- Does the URL change in the browser?
- Any errors in console?
- Does the content on screen change?
