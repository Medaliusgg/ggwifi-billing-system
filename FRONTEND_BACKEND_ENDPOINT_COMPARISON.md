## 🔍 Frontend is Calling (From api.js)

All frontend calls are **CORRECT**:
- ✅ `/admin/users` - Correct
- ✅ `/admin/customers` - Correct
- ✅ `/admin/packages` - Correct
- ✅ `/admin/vouchers` - Correct
- ✅ `/admin/routers` - Correct
- ✅ `/admin/payments` - Correct
- ✅ `/admin/transactions` - Correct
- ✅ `/admin/invoices` - Correct

## ❌ PROBLEM IDENTIFIED

The frontend **baseURL** is: `https://api.ggwifi.co.tz/api/v1`

So when the frontend calls `/admin/users`, it becomes:
`https://api.ggwifi.co.tz/api/v1/admin/users`

But the backend SecurityConfig was only protecting `/admin/**` paths, NOT `/api/v1/admin/**`!

## ✅ SOLUTION ALREADY APPLIED

I've already fixed this by adding `/api/v1/admin/**` patterns to SecurityConfig:
```java
.requestMatchers("/admin/**", "/api/v1/admin/**").hasAnyRole("ADMIN", "SUPER_ADMIN")
```

And similar for all other endpoints.

## 📝 Summary

- ✅ Frontend API calls are **CORRECT**
- ✅ Backend endpoints are **CORRECT**
- ✅ SecurityConfig has been updated to protect **BOTH** patterns
- ✅ Backend has been deployed with the fix

**The 403 errors should be resolved now!**
