# ‚ùå Backend Not Running - Solution

## Problem Identified

The customer portal is getting **403 errors** because:
1. ‚ùå Backend is NOT running locally (port 8080)
2. ‚ùå Backend is NOT deployed to production (api.ggwifi.co.tz)
3. ‚úÖ Frontend code is correct and deployed

## üîß Immediate Solution: Start Backend Locally

### Option 1: Quick Start for Testing

```bash
# Navigate to backend directory
cd /home/medalius/Desktop/PROJECT\ 3./GG-WIFI\ WEB-APP/backend

# Start the backend
nohup java -jar target/ggnetworks-backend-1.0.0.jar > backend.log 2>&1 &

# Check if it's running
curl http://localhost:8080/api/v1/customer-portal/packages
```

### Option 2: Using Maven (Development)

```bash
cd backend
mvn spring-boot:run
```

### Verify Backend is Running

```bash
# Check if port 8080 is listening
netstat -tlnp | grep 8080

# Test the endpoint
curl http://localhost:8080/api/v1/customer-portal/test

# Check logs
tail -f backend.log
```

## üöÄ Production Solution: Deploy Backend to VPS

You have **two options**:

### Option A: Deploy to VPS (Recommended for Production)

1. **Get a VPS** (DigitalOcean, AWS, or any provider)
2. **Deploy the backend** using your existing scripts
3. **Point DNS** `api.ggwifi.co.tz` to your VPS
4. **Configure Nginx** as reverse proxy

**Files you already have for VPS deployment:**
- `backend/deploy-to-vps.sh`
- `backend/setup-database-vps.sh`
- `backend/DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md`

### Option B: Use Railway/Render (No VPS Needed)

1. **Railway** or **Render** - Free tier available
2. **Push backend code** to their platform
3. **Set environment variables**
4. **Get public URL** for API
5. **Update Cloudflare** env vars with new API URL

## üìã Quick Start Script

I can create a simple start script for you. Would you like me to:

1. ‚úÖ Create a `start-backend.sh` script to start the backend locally?
2. ‚úÖ Help you deploy to production (VPS or Railway)?
3. ‚úÖ Test the connection after starting?

## Current Status

- ‚úÖ Frontend: Deployed and working
- ‚úÖ Code: Fixed API connection issues  
- ‚ùå Backend: Not running (needs to be started)
- ‚ùå API: Not accessible at https://api.ggwifi.co.tz

## Next Steps

**Choose one:**
1. **Start locally now** - I'll create a script to start the backend
2. **Deploy to production** - I'll guide you through VPS deployment
3. **Use Railway/Render** - I'll help you deploy to a free hosting service

Which option would you like to proceed with?
